## Why do you need a portfolio? ‚òùÔ∏è

Having a portfolio is an essential tool for developers to showcase their work and skills. It provides a professional way to display your projects and achievements to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. A portfolio increases your visibility and online presence, showing that you are more than just a resume.

## Deployment üì¶

Once you finish your setup, you need to put your website online! I highly recommend using Netlify because it is super easy and provides many useful features for hosting static websites.

Here are the steps to deploy your website to Netlify:

1. Create a free account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Click on the `New site from Git` button on your dashboard.
3. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository that contains your website.
4. Configure the build settings according to your project's requirements.
5. Click on the `Deploy site` button, and wait for the deployment to complete.
6. Once the deployment is finished, you can access your website using the URL provided by Netlify.

That's it! Now your website is live and accessible to the world. You can also set up custom domain, SSL, forms, and many other features using Netlify's dashboard.
